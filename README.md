SVD and attribution analysis
Crop Data
Considering potential inconsistencies among classification products, both maize (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02573-6) and winter wheat (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12003990) maps were derived from a unified crop mapping dataset. For maize and winter wheat, the classification accuracies were 79.38% and 91.17%, respectively. For this study, crop distribution data spanning 2003-2020 were extracted for the plain and reprojected to a sinusoidal equal-area projection to ensure consistency with the LST dataset. 
 LST Data
This study employed a monthly mean LST dataset (https://zenodo.org/records/6618442). The product applies a multi-temporal weighted averaging method to generate global 1 km monthly LST data spanning 2003-2020. It has demonstrated high accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.60 K. Specifically, monthly LST values were averaged for each year from 2003 to 2020 within the study area, resulting in a continuous annual LST record.
Attribution Data
The MCD43A3 albedo dataset provides global white-sky albedo (WSA) and black-sky albedo (BSA) at a spatial resolution of 500 m (https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov). The 16-day composites were aggregated into annual means, and the original 500 m pixels were averaged in 2×2 blocks to produce 1 km resolution data. 
The Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Downward Shortwave Radiation (DSR) product provides spatially continuous global daily surface shortwave radiation data  (https://www.glass.hku.hk), with a spatial resolution of 0.05°. In this study, each 0.05° grid cell was mapped onto a 5×5 grid of 1 km pixels to obtain annual DSR data for the plain during 2003–2020. 
The annual surface latent heat flux (LE) data for 2003–2020 were obtained from the 500 m MOD16A3GF product  (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov). Four MODIS tiles (h26v04, h26v05, h27v04, and h27v05) covering the study area were extracted and resampled to 1 km resolution to match other datasets. Specifically, each 1 km LE pixel was computed as the average of 2×2 500 m pixels. 
The GLASS Broadband Emissivity (BBE) product is derived from MODIS data, with a temporal resolution of 8-days and a spatial resolution of 1 km (https://glass.hku.hk). The 8-day emissivity data were aggregated into annual means to characterize yearly surface emissivity. 
Auxiliary Data
To minimize the influence of non-crop areas on temperature effect estimates, this study utilized the 30 m China Land Cover Dataset (CLCD) as a cropland reference  (https://zenodo.org/records/12779975) . The dataset was developed by deriving spatiotemporal features from all variable Landsat observations on Google Earth Engine with an overall accuracy of 80%.
